## Something about research group

My research group studies uncertainties in the estimation
of level sets of random fields. A noval tool to do so
are confidence probability excursion (CoPE) sets, which
have been introduced in [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2017.1341838).
We aim to refine, apply and generalize this tool by especially
introducing different error criteria measures which resamble properties of FDR control.
