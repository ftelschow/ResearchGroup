## MATH+ Junior Research Group on Statistical Inversion and Quantification of Uncertainties

Since Spring 2021 I have a junior research group at the HU Berlin funded by the MATH+ Excellence Cluster
for mathematics. The topics we are interested are mainly the quantification of uncertainties in the estimation
of level sets of random fields. The approach is inspired by confidence probability excursion (CoPE) sets, which
have been introduced in [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2017.1341838) and are an
active research topic I collaborate on with the group of Armin Schwartzman at the University of Californa, San
Diego, and the group of Thomas Nichols at the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford.
Currently, we aim to refine and generalize the CoPE set approach in several ways to apply it not only to
smooth imaging data, but also less smooth data and discrete data. Another line of generalization will be
introducing different error criteria measures for CoPE sets. Currently it relies on a concept similar to the
family wise error rate in multiple testing. We aim to extend it to criteria more similar to FDR control.
