I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the Humboldt-University Berlin.
I studied at the Georg-August-University in GÃ¶ttingen and received my
PhD there under the Supervision of Prof. Dr. Stephan Huckemann.
Afterwards I was a postdoctoral employee at the University of California,
San Diego, under the supervision of Armin Schwartzman.

I work on developing mainly inferential tools for random fields with
applications in Neuroimaging, Astrophysics and beyond.

If you're interested in collaborating or have a
question about my work please feel free to email me.
