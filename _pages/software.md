## R-packages:
You can find three R-packages on my github, which implement statistical inference methods based on
the Gaussian Kinematic formula and other approaches.

* **Sample fields**: can be used to generate different types of data
* **RFT**: implements the basic 
* **SIRF**: Statistical Inference for Random Fields implements inferential methods, such as simultaneous Confidence Bands. It will also contain CoPE sets in the future.

## RFTtoolbox (beta) for MATLAB
The RFTtoolbox contains code to generate smooth Gaussian, t and F fields (with a zero or non-zero mean, the peaks of which can be specified) on a lattice of arbitrary size accounting for the edge effect. As well as signal generation: allowing specification of peaks with a variety of atributes (location, radius, height). It will soon contain code to perform clusterwise inference and analysis, thresholding using LKCs, generation of convolution fields and many more features.
